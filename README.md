# NewController :video_game:
Just a controller for having a fun with JavaScript and CSS :D

## Explaining That Repository 

I'm trying to study *JavaScript* and learn more about *Git* and *GitHub* too, so thats is my little project what I doing for that...
I would like to add some functionalities to the buttons, like change the background color, change the background to a gif or something like that. Its just for having a fun and studying at the same time,so if your have an idea and want to added, for now we have **22** buttons for that functionalities!
